# Object Oriented Python

This repository is just for python practice. 
The main goal for practice is to work with Object-Oriented Python.

*Note: I am working on this from both my PC and my Macbook. My PC is my main workstation. Sometimes I'll code outdoors with my Macbook, but unfortunetely the "N" key on the Macbook doesn't work well. So if there's ay missing "N's" in the comments, that's why.
